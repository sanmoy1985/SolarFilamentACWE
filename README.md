# SolarFilamentACWE
This repository implements an ACWE-based algorithm for detecting solar filaments in H-alpha full-disk solar images. The algorithm uses a three-step process: pre-processing, segmentation, and post-processing, where deformable contours evolve based on an energy function until they reach the object boundary and minimize the energy.
